## General pathway information

#### :books: [ENDOCRINE HISTORY: The history of discovery, synthesis and development of testosterone for clinical use](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30959485/)

* Androgens are an important class of __C19 steroid hormones that play a crucial role in male sexual differentiation, development, and reproductive function__. Principal androgens include dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
* Testosterone is the primary circulating androgen, synthesized mainly in the Leydig cells of the testes under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH). In addition, androgens are massively synthesized in the adrenal cortex.
* Testosterone can act directly on its receptor or serve as a precursor of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estradiol (E2) in peripheral tissues. This local conversion allows tissues to finely regulate androgen action via intracrine mechanisms.
* Testosterone is synthesized from cholesterol, the common precursor of all steroid hormones. In androgen-responsive tissues, testosterone is further reduced to DHT by 5α-reductase. This enhances androgenic potency, as DHT binds the androgen receptor with higher affinity and greater transcriptional activity than testosterone. DHT is considered the most potent natural androgen and cannot be aromatized into estrogen.
 

#### :books: [Androgen Physiology: Receptor and Metabolic Disorders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25905257/)

* Both testosterone and DHT exert their biological effects through the androgen receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily.
* In the cytoplasm, the inactive AR molecules are linked to heat-shock protein chaperones. Upon binding its ligand in the cytoplasm, androgen receptor undergoes a conformational shift and translocates into the nucleus where it binds specific DNA sequences (Androgen Response Elements) to regulate gene transcription in target tissues.
* The receptor (about 920 amino acids) is organized into three main domains: (I) an intrinsically disordered N terminal domain rich in activation functions and engages in key protein-protein interactions; (II) the DNA-binding domain (DBD) features zinc fingers for DNA specificity and dimerization; (III) the ligand-binding domain (LBD) enables hormone responsiveness and coactivator recruitment, including via AF-2 and the BF-3 cleft.
* The androgen receptor also engages in a rapid, non-genomic signaling through cross talk with the Scr, Raf-1, Erk-2 pathway. This fast cascade promotes cell proliferation and survival without requiring AR to enter the nucleus or bind DNA. (Iain J McEwan et al., 2021)

## Physiological effect of the hormone

Androgens exert a wide variety of physiological effects, directly via androgen receptor activation and indirectly through conversion to other hormones.

* Testosterone plays a foundational role in male development, beginning in the fetus by driving the formation of the male genital tract.
* Later in life, it remains essential for spermatogenesis, enabling the production and maturation of sperm within the testes.
* At puberty, testosterone, often converted to DHT in target tissues, triggers the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair, deepening of the voice, and prostate maturation.
* Beyond reproductive functions, androgens exert powerful anabolic effects: they enhance muscle mass and strength by promoting protein synthesis and bone growth, contributing to overall physical performance and bone health.
* In the central nervous system, testosterone influences libido, mood regulation, and behavior, including traits like motivation and aggression.
* It also plays a key role in body composition by reducing fat mass, encouraging lean muscle growth, and influencing fat distribution.
* Testosterone stimulates sebaceous glands in the skin, which affects oil production and hair growth patterns.

Importantly, androgen levels, and their biological impact, vary with age, sex, and metabolic status, underlining their complex, interconnected influence on endocrine, metabolic, reproductive, immune, and neurological health. (Alemany, 2022) (Iain J McEwan et al., 2021)

## Impact on neurodevelopment


* :books: [Genes and Pathways Regulated by Androgens in Human Neural Cells, Potential Candidates for the Male Excess in Autism Spectrum Disorder ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428674/)
* Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a significant role in shaping early brain development by regulating gene expression in human neural cells. RNA sequencing analyses have demonstrated that DHT induces subtle but consistent changes in the expression of approximately 200 genes, many of which are involved in critical developmental processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling and growth factor signaling pathways, including those related to insulin and IGF1.
* Several of the most strongly regulated genes by DHT, (e.g RGCC, NRCAM, FAM107A, IGFBP5, and LAMA2) have been implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorder, either through direct genetic association or through altered expression patterns. Experimental approaches using overexpression and knockdown of the androgen receptor in neural cells have confirmed that these effects are androgen receptor-dependent, as many of the DHT-responsive genes contain androgen receptor binding sites identified through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. 

* :books: [Androgen Receptor signaling promotes the neural progenitor cell pool in the developing cortex](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32959393/). DHT promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation and survival, processes driven via PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, suggesting that elevated prenatal androgen exposure may expand the neural precursor pool during cortical formation and influence early onset neurodevelopmental disorders with male bias. (La Rosa et al., 2021; Quartier et al., 2018). 

* Prenatal exposure to testosterone has been shown to have long-lasting, sex-specific effects on the organization of brain networks involved in social cognition, particularly the default mode network (DMN). Variations in fetal testosterone levels during midgestational development influence the structural connectivity within the DMN differently in males and females.  Additionally, dihydrotestosterone, has been found to dysregulate several genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and intellectual disability. These genes, many of which are involved in synaptic function and excitation–inhibition balance, show expression patterns that align with DMN regions, further supporting the role of androgens in shaping social brain circuitry during development.(Lombardo et al., 2018) These findings highlight a plausible molecular and cellular mechanism by which elevated prenatal androgen exposure might contribute to the observed male bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders, by influencing both the quantity and quality of developing neural circuits.

## In vitro experiment with iPSC and neuronal models

* Recent studies on (iPSC)-derived brain organoids have provided insights into how androgens such as dihydrotestosterone and testosterone modulate early brain development.
* In organoids from both sexes, treatment with either DHT or testosterone led to a consistent increase in the proliferation of radial glial stem cells, leading to an expansion of intermediate progenitor cells and an increased production of excitatory neurons. This effect is androgen specific and is not seen with estradiol treatment, implying a unique hormonal mechanism underpinning sexual dimorphism in brain development.
* Transcriptomic analyses revealed that androgens dysregulated gene expression. Upregulated genes enriched with terms associated with brain size and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Differentially expressed genes support increased mTOR signaling, with altered expression of genes linked to disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (e.g., MCM4, PHB1) and schizophrenia (VPS13C, SELENBP1, GABBR1, SPTLC2). These hormonal effects help explain sexual dimorphism in brain structure and function, which may underlie sex-biased prevalence in disorders like ASD and schizophrenia. (Kelava et al., 2022), (Abrahams et al., 2013), (Hackinger et al., 2018), (Udawela et al., 2015); (Fatemi et al., 2011); (Narayan et al., 2009)

## Epidemiological data 

* The NIH Study of Normal Brain Development, a longitudinal cohort of typically developing children and adolescents aged 4-24 years (n=433), demonstrated that higher testosterone and DHEA levels are associated with distinct patterns of cortical maturation and connectivity. Specifically, higher testosterone in post-pubertal boys was linked to reduced cortical thickness in prefrontal regions and predicted increased aggression and reduced executive function. In contrast, DHEA showed positive effects on cortical development and cognitive performance, such as enhanced attention and working memory, suggesting a potential modulatory role that may counteract the adverse effects of testosterone. (Nguyen, 2018)
* Large-scale genetic data from the SPARK cohort supported the hypothesis that elevated net androgen exposure contributes to social functioning deficits across sexes, reinforcing the relevance of prenatal hormonal programming in conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorded. (McKenna et al., 2021)
* Studies on individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) further underscore the role of early androgen exposure in shaping cognitive and behavioral outcomes. For example, females with CAH exhibit more male-typical play behavior and may show domain-specific cognitive differences, including potential impairments in mathematical ability and advantages in spatial skills. (Nass & Baker, 1991)
* Androgen receptors are widely distributed in both male and female brains, including areas such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, amygdala, corpus callosum, and cingulate cortex. Research has shown that fetal testosterone levels are linked to the development of sexually dimorphic traits, particularly in cognition and behavior. For example, girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)—who are exposed to higher levels of androgens before birth—tend to show more male-typical play behaviors during childhood. These findings suggest that prenatal androgen exposure may influence behavioral development, potentially contributing to traits observed in autistic phenotypes. :books: [Gestational Hyperandrogenism in Developmental Programming](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2016-1801).

## Evidence of EDCs disruption of the pathway

* Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, has emerged as a significant factor influencing female reproductive health, particularly in the context of hyperandrogenic disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
* This is a bidirectional interaction: evidence indicates that individuals with elevated androgen levels tend to show higher serum concentrations of BPA, suggesting that hyperandrogenism may reduce the efficiency of metabolic clearance pathways, such as those involving UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, leading to the accumulation of endocrine disruptors and amplifying hormonal imbalances. (Takeuchi et al., 2004) (Takeuchi et al., 2006) 
* :books: [Elevated serum bisphenol A levels under hyperandrogenic conditions may be caused by decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829708/)
* :books: [Positive relationship between androgen and the endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A, in normal women and women with ovarian dysfunction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15118266/)
* Further research in animal models has shown that phthalates can impair ovarian steroidogenesis by downregulating key steroidogenic enzymes in theca cells. Specifically, exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been shown to reduce the expression of enzymes such as Cyp17a1, which is essential for androgen biosynthesis. These disruptions in steroidogenesis during early folliculogenesis may interfere with the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis and potentially delay the onset of puberty. :books: [Di (2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate Exposure Impairs Growth of Antral Follicle in Mice](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148350)
* Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), particularly bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, can lead to long-term reproductive consequences. In animal models, such exposure has been associated with disrupted ovarian development, altered hormone production, and changes in steroidogenic enzyme expression. Specifically, prenatal EDC exposure can result in polycystic ovarian morphology, elevated androgen levels, and hormone profiles resembling those found in PCOS.

## Crosstalk with other pathways 

Androgens do not operate in isolation; rather, they engage in complex crosstalk with several key hormonal pathways. 

* Androgens are not just ligands for the androgen receptor. Crucially, they also serve as precursors for estrogen synthesis via the enzyme aromatase, enabling a dynamic hormonal interplay. Estrogens are far more potent than their androgen precursors, and this local conversion supports dynamic hormone interconversion and regulatory balance (Blakemore & Naftolin, 2016).

* Androgens are produced not only in the gonads but also in the adrenal cortex, where they share critical biosynthetic and regulatory pathways with glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids. A classic example is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, most caused by genetic mutations in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. When this enzyme is deficient, cortisol synthesis is blocked, resulting in persistently low cortisol levels. This deficiency disrupts negative feedback on ACTH. As cortisol precursors accumulate, such as 17 hydroxyprogesterone, they are rerouted into the androgen synthesis pathway, causing a dramatic increase in adrenal androgens (Turcu et al., 2014).

* The androgen receptor (AR) sits at the heart of a complex steroid receptor network, influencing gene expression through extensive chromatin-level interactions with receptors such as ER, PR, GR. The crosstalk between signal-dependent TFs is an important step in the reprogramming of chromatin sites. a signal-activated TF can expand or restrict the chromatin binding of another TF. This crosstalk can rewire gene programs and thus alter biological processes and influence the progression of diseases like breast or prostate cancer. For example, in prostate cancer, AR-targeted treatments enable GR to increase its expression and occupy AR-binding sites on pre-accessible chromatin, a switch that sustains androgen-response transcription programs and drives therapy resistance (Paakinaho & Palvimo, 2021).

* Thyroid hormones bind to the AR gene promoter and elevate its expression. They also increase levels of 5α-reductase, promoting conversion of testosterone into more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which further strengthens AR signaling. AR, in turn, binds to androgen response elements (AREs) in promoters of thyroid-related genes, such as deiodinases and thyroid receptor isoforms, reinforcing a feedback loop between the androgen and thyroid systems (Torabinejad et al., 2023).

* Androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormones constantly intersect through shared precursors, receptor-level competition and cooperation, and chromatin-level interactions.
