### 1.1 CTL04

#### 1.1.A Main gene signature
* Both agonist and antagonist treatments induced upregulation of **cell cycle genes** and downregulation of **inhibitory and lower-layer neuronal markers** ([GABAergic neurons decrease upon TCDD exposure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24060430/)).
* **Outer radial glia** markers were generally downregulated; however, the antagonist consistently increased HOPX expression. This is notable, as AhR agonists have been reported to inhibit proliferation of human and murine neural progenitor cells ([TCDD inhibits NPC proliferation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15157999/)).
* The **excitatory neuron** marker NEUROG1 was strongly upregulated by the agonist.

#### 1.1.B Metabolism genes
* Most **cholesterol biosynthesis** genes were moderately downregulated, consistent with AhR-mediated suppression of LSS, HMGCR, and SQLE expression independent of the xenobiotic response element ([AhR downregulates cholesterol enzymes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22234961/)).
* STAR expression was increased by both agonist and antagonist.
* The antagonist specifically upregulated ACAT2, MVK, and DHCR24, while downregulating MSMO1.

#### 1.1.C Receptor signature
* Both agonist and antagonist treatments reduced expression of **AHR**, **ESRRB**, and **glucocorticoid receptor** genes.
* Antagonist treatment exclusively downregulated **thyroid hormone pathway** genes (primarily THRA and KLF9), whereas the agonist selectively downregulated ESRRG and THRB. In murine models, AhR activation by agonist also suppresses estrogen receptor α and estradiol-metabolizing enzymes ([ERα downregulated by AhR agonist](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15858227/)).
* The antagonist additionally upregulated the **retinoic acid transporter** RBP4, RXRG, and the **thyroid hormone transporter** MCT10; in contrast, the agonist upregulated RXRA.
* Both agonist and antagonist treatments increased expression of the deactivating enzyme DIO3.

#### 1.1.D Target genes
* **Androgen targets**  
  * Agonist strongly downregulated SIRT1 (contrary to androgen agonist but similar to its inhibitor) and YBX1, while upregulating RPL6 and PES1.  
  * Antagonist upregulated EML1, mirroring androgen inhibitor effects. In HUVECs, AhR activation suppresses SIRT1 activity via NAD⁺/NADH imbalance; conversely, SIRT1 deacetylates promoters of several steroid receptors and induces AHR expression.  
  * AhR inhibition attenuates androgen receptor signalling.  
* **Estrogen targets**  
  * FABP7 was downregulated by both modulators (more strongly by antagonist), opposite to estrogen agonist effects.  
  * AQP4 was upregulated by both compounds, consistent with estrogen agonist treatment.  
* **Glucocorticoid targets**  
  * FKBP5 was strongly induced by both modulators, similar to GR agonist. SGK1 was downregulated by the agonist.  
* **Retinoid targets**  
  * CBLN2 and MEIS2 were both upregulated by the antagonist.  
* **Thyroid targets**  
  * CYP26B1 and KLF9 were strongly downregulated by the antagonist.  
  * SEMA3C was downregulated by the agonist and oppositely regulated relative to thyroid modulators.  
* **Liver X targets**  
  * The agonist downregulated MYLIP and ABCG1.  
* **Aryl hydrocarbon targets**  
  * CDKN1B was strongly downregulated by the antagonist.

### 1.2 CTL08

#### 1.2.A Main gene signature
* Both agonist and antagonist treatments increased expression of **cell cycle genes**, though to a lesser extent than in CTL04.
* Antagonist treatment downregulated **inhibitory neuron** and **outer radial glia** markers, with the exception of HOPX, consistent with CTL04. Modulation of NEUROG1 was influenced by differentiation batch effects.

#### 1.2.B Metabolism genes
* Most **cholesterol biosynthesis** genes appeared downregulated relative to CTL04, but strong batch bias precludes definitive conclusions versus DMSO.
* Opposing regulation of **17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases** was observed (decrease with agonist, increase with antagonist).

#### 1.2.C Receptor genes
* **Androgen receptor** expression was reduced by the agonist. In prostate cancer models, AhR inhibition decreases AR expression by ~60% ([AhR inhibition reduces AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495210/)), although this was not replicated here.
* As in CTL04, the antagonist upregulated RBP4 and RXRG, but not MCT10.

#### 1.2.D Target genes
* **Androgen targets**  
  * Agonist downregulated SIRT1, whereas antagonist downregulated RPL6 (similar to androgen agonist).  
* **Estrogen targets**  
  * RTP1 was the sole gene modulated by the agonist, with a trend opposite to estrogen agonist.  
* **Glucocorticoid targets**  
  * FKBP5 and SGK1 were strongly induced by both modulators, as with GR agonist.  
* **Retinoid targets**  
  * CBLN2 and MEIS2 were upregulated by the antagonist, as in CTL04.  
* **Thyroid targets**  
  * No significant observations.  
* **Liver X targets**  
  * SREBF1 was strongly downregulated.  
* **Aryl hydrocarbon targets**  
  * CYP1B1 and COMT appeared upregulated by the agonist; however, batch effects prevent definitive conclusions.

## Thyroid

### 7.1 CTL04

#### 7.1.A Main gene signature
* __Cell cycle__ in the agonist group all genes are consistently downregulated whereas no changes can be observed in the antagonist. Given the absence of THRA and THRB downregulation, this is partially in contrast with the evidence that THRA is fundamental for neural progenitors proliferation in human brain cortex development. On the opposite side, it has been shown that  T3 blocks the proliferation and favours the differentiation of human neuroblastoma NA2alpha-beta cells through THRbeta1 isoform. **Refs**: [Mutations in thyroid hormone receptor α1 cause premature neurogenesis and progenitor cell depletion in human cortical development](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1908762116); [Cell cycle control by the thyroid hormone in neuroblastoma cells](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00277-9)
* __NSC__ clear upregulation of the NSC markers LIX1 and TRPM3 in the agonist group can be observed whereas ythe antagonist upregulates JARID2 and HMGA2
* __Apical Prog__ in the agonist group, HES1 is the only upregulated gene, whereas all other markers are downregulated. In the antagonist, we observe consistent upregulation of PAX6, whereas Nestin and SOX1 appear downregulated.
* __Intermediate Prog__ out of 3 markers, AHRGAP11B and NHLH1 are downregulated and ELAV4 upregulated similarly by agonist and antagonist. The only eivdence of ELAV4 regulation by T3 is in mouse and rat brains but in that cases T3 downregulates ELAV4 (aka HuD). HuD is a factor that binds mRNAs and is able to modify their half-life.
* __oRG__ In both agonist and antagonist HOPX is upregulated, whereas all other markers are unchanged in the agonist but highly downregulated in the antagonist
* __Pan Neuron__ all pan neuronal markers are moderately upregulated by both treatments although the agonist is the more prominent. This is in line with evidente that T3 is fundamental for neuronal maturation.
* __excitatory__ excitatory neuronal markers are generally downregulated with the exception of NEUROG1 and SLC17A7 (Vglut) which are consistently increased by both agonist and antagonist
* __Inhibitory__ Clear mirror effect in the expression of GAD1 and GAD2: T3 stimulates, antagonist inhibits. Ths is consistent with evidence from multiple models that T3 stimulates GABAergic neurons proliferation and maturation. **Ref**: [_Thyroid hormone-dependent development of early cortical networks: temporal specificity and the contribution of trkB and mTOR pathways_](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00121) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2013.00121/full#B42
* __Lower layer__ Agonist strongly upregulates RORB, whereas antagonist slightly downregulates CTIP2 expression with minimal effects on RORB. This is in general consistent with evidence that THRA mutant human hiPSC produce mostly deep layer neurons due to premature exit of neural prog. from the cell cycle. **Ref**: [_Mutations in thyroid hormone receptor α1 cause premature neurogenesis and progenitor cell depletion in human cortical development_](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1908762116)
* __Upper Layer__ mild variations, of relevance reduction of SATB2 expression upon agonist and reduction of CUX2 upon antagonist
* __Astrocytes__ AQP4 is upregulated by both compounds whereas RANBP3L only by the agonist. GFAP and ALDH1L1 are downregulated by both treatments with more pronounced effects in the antagonist group
* __Oligodendrocytes__ All genes axcept MYRF (down in Agonist) and PMP22 (down in both) are upregulated, consistent with evidence that T3 is fundamental for myelin gene activation during oligo maturation through KLF9. **Refs**: [_Oligodendrocyte maturation and progenitor cell proliferation are independently regulated by thyroid hormone_](https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1098-1136(199704)19:4%3C324::aid-glia5%3E3.0.co;2-x); [_The T3-induced gene KLF9 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin regeneration_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472204/)

#### 7.1.B Metabolism genes
* Overall, cholesterol biosynthesis genes are downregulated in both treatment groups with some exceptions: ACAT1 is slightly upregulated by agonist whereas in the antagonist there is strong upregulation of HSD17B7. Finally, SC5D is upregulated by both treatments. Evidence suggests that Thyroid hormone in the liver enhances cholesterol biosynthesis indirectly by enhancing cholesterol uptake and conversion into bile acid, therefore depriving the tissue from cholesterol.
* All steroids biogenesis detected genes are upregulated by the agonist. In the antagonist group we observe striking downregulation of AKR1C3 and SRD5A3, this expression profile is mostly superimposable to that of the negative control (w/o DMSO)

#### 7.1.C Receptor signature
* Aryl hydrocarbons receptor is mildly stimulated by agonist and repressed by antagonist. We observe strong inhibition of androgen receptor upon T3 treatment, mild increase upon inhibitor treatment. ESRRB and ESRRG are upregulated by agonist and downregulated by antagonist with stronger effects on ESRRB. GC and LXRA receptors are downregulated by both whereas LXRB is upregulated by antagonist
* as for the retinoids genes, both conditions upregulate RXRG, RARB and RBP4 while downregulate RARG and RARA (milder). RXRA is only downregulated by agonist.
* As expected for thyroid genes, we observe KLF9 and DIO3 upregulateion in both treatment (stronger effects in the agonist group, consistent with NH3 being a partial agonist). MCT8 appears downregulated by both treatments whereas slc7a5 (LAT1) is downregulated by agonist and upregulated by antagonist. Overall, the expression profile hormonal target genes in the thyroid agonist group appears to be mostly opposite to that of androgen agonist whereas the thryoid antagonist is not clearly specular (and thus similar to androgen agonist).

#### 7.1.D Target genes
* Androgens: Clear inhibition of EML1, RPL6 and PES1 by the agonist, upregulation of EIF2B3. The antagonist strongly inhibits EML1, mildly PES1 and upregulates YBX1, RPL6 and SIRT1 (the strongest effect). Again, for half the genes the effects appear opposite to the androgen agonist.
* Estrogens: FABP7 is downregulated only by the antagonist, whereas AQP4 is upregulated in both groups, the antagonist having the stronger effect.
* Glucocorticoids: All targets are upregulated by both treatments with the exception of FKBP5 which appears mildly downregulated (mostly by agonist)
* Retinoids: RAI1 is downregulated by the agonist with no effect in the antagonist. All genes strongly upregulated by retinoid agonist group (CBLN2, MEIS2 and SYP) are all upregulated by both agonist and antagonist.
* Thyroid: KLF9 is upregulated by both treatments. CYP26B1 and SEMA3C are upregulated by agonist and inhibited by antagonist whereas BCL6 shown specular inhibition by agonist and upregulation by antagonist. All genes on the thyroid pathway are regardless modulated by both treatments in respect to DMSO.
* LiverX: ABCA1 and ABCG1 are mildly upregulated by agonist but only ABCA1 is upregulated more strongly by antagonist, ABCG1 slightly decreases. SREBF1 strongly downregulated by both. APOE is upregulated by antagonist only (Agonist decreases but not consistent btw replicates). LDLR is downregulated by agonist.
* Aryl hyd.: COMT is downregulated strongly by both agonist and antagonist whereas CDKN1B is upregulated by the antagonist

* __Lower layer__ ND
* __Upper Layer__ ND
* __Astrocytes__ Consistent upregulation of AQP4, IGFP and GFAP by agonist
